<p>Blackfriday is a Markdown processor implemented in Go. It is paranoid about its input (so you can safely feed it user-supplied data), it is fast, it supports common extensions (tables, smart
punctuation substitutions, etc.), and it is safe for all UTF-8 (unicode) input.</p>

<p>HTML output is currently supported, along with Smartypants
extensions. An experimental LaTeX output engine is also included.</p>

<p>It started as a translation from C of Sundown.</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<pre><code>go get github.com/russross/blackfriday
</code></pre>

<p>will download, compile, and install the package into your <code>$GOPATH</code>
directory hierarchy. Alternatively, you can achieve the same if you
import it into a project:</p>

<pre><code>import &quot;github.com/russross/blackfriday&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>and <code>go get</code> without parameters.</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>For basic usage, it is as simple as getting your input into a byte
slice and calling:</p>

<pre><code>output := blackfriday.MarkdownBasic(input)
</code></pre>

<p>This renders it with no extensions enabled. To get a more useful
feature set, use this instead:</p>

<pre><code>output := blackfriday.MarkdownCommon(input)
</code></pre>

<h3>Sanitize untrusted content</h3>

<p>Blackfriday itself does nothing to protect against malicious content. If you are
dealing with user-supplied markdown, we recommend running blackfriday&rsquo;s output
through HTML sanitizer such as
<a href="https://github.com/microcosm-cc/bluemonday">Bluemonday</a>.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of simple usage of blackfriday together with bluemonday:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">import (
    &quot;github.com/microcosm-cc/bluemonday&quot;
    &quot;github.com/russross/blackfriday&quot;
)

// ...
unsafe := blackfriday.MarkdownCommon(input)
html := bluemonday.UGCPolicy().SanitizeBytes(unsafe)
</code></pre>
